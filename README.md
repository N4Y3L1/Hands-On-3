# Hands-On-3
Topic: Gradient descent-based Optimization of Predictive Models
Fashion: personal (see G Classroom)
To build a Java App  for calculating the parameter models for  the Simple Linear Regression (SLR) technique; implemented during online sessions.
You ought to use Gradient Descent in order to find Beta_0 and Beta_1.
You ought to adopt and appropriate Object Oriented approach by both abstracting and implementing all helper classes. 
(See Benetton’s case)

## Hands-on 3: specs
#### App’s Inputs:
A set of observations:
DataSet will be hard coded.
An X value to predict Y. Provide your App with such a X value through the Command Line Interface (cmd/bash).
#### App’s Outputs:
Print regression equation:                                         on CLI by replacing coefficients calculated values. 
The App must allow to make single predictions by providing it with an X value and then, printing the calculated Y value.
